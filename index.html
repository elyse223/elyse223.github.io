			<h2> Brief Explanation </h2>
			<p> Formula 1 is a worldwide known sport, with races spanning all over the world. Millions of dollars go into the car, set up, team, and equipment. It is all up to the constructors to create the best car and continue to upgrade throughout the season according to the performance. The final goal is to win the Constructor's Championship and the Driver's Championship. This sport not only is about the drivers and teams, but the controversy, arguments, and tension between the FIA, the individual drivers, and members on each team. Each season has new rules in the handbook, new drivers, cars, team principles, sponsors, and new talent. </p>
